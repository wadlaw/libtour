# LIB Tour 2024

LIB Tour is a fun competition involving 18 individual competitions (listed below) and an overall team event. Prizes can be won as an individual or as a team at each event and at the end of the season for the top 3 teams.

## Summary of Changes for 2024

> - £20 Entrance fee to be charged. This will be used for the team prizes
> - More team prizes!
> - If you play in an event and your team wins the team event, your £5 entry will be refunded
> - Wildcards only count toward team events - not individual prizes

# Teams

Once you are entered into the LIB Tour, you will be assigned to a team. Team selection is via a live draft where team captains will take turns to pick a player from the available pool of players. The order in which captains pick will be the reverse order of the previous year's final team table (ie the team finishing last will get first pick)
There are currently 8 teams:

- Balls Deep
- Big Sticks
- Bogey Boys
- The Eurekas
- The Swingers
- Regular Flex
- Two Ballers
- Shanks and Big Hook

# Entry Fees

**There is a £20 entrance fee to be part of the LIB Tour**. This money is used to cover the end of season team prizes.

> LIB Tour events are closely tied to official club competitions. Once you are a member of the LIB Tour, if you enter a club competition that is part of the LIB Tour, you are also entering the LIB Tour event for that competition. Correspondingly, to enter the LIB Tour event, you will need to enter the club competition.

**The entry fee is £5 for each individual player playing in the event**. Please ensure this is paid before the start of the day's competition. Non-payers will be tracked down/harassed/publicly shamed until payment is received.

Entry fees can be paid in cash to **Danny Innes**, **Tom Whitelaw**, **Greg Hammond** or **Chris O'Donoghue**.

If you want to pay by **bank transfer**, please make payment by bank transfer. If you need details, please ask

Please add your name and the name of the competition to the reference so your payment can be identified.

# Prizes

All entry fees are paid out as prizes. The prize structure has been tweaked for 2024 to allow for more team prizes.

#### End of season team prize

The entrance fees paid by all LIB Tour members will be put forward towards the end of season team prizes. This gives us a **team prize pot of £800**. This will be split as follows:

- 1st Place Team wins **£500**
- 2nd Place Team wins **£200**
- 3rd Place Team wins **£100**

#### Event prizes

For each event, the **playing members of the winning team will have their £5 entrance fee refunded to them**.
Each event will offer individual prizes based on the number of entrants and how many players from the winning team get a refund. Prize breakdown is as follows:

| Available Prize Pot |    1st |    2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th |

Individual prizes will be paid out after each event (subject to all entry fees being received)

# Wildcards

_Changed for 2024 - the Wildcard adjustment will only count towards the team score - not the individual_

Each team receives a _Wildcard_ for each event. Before the start of the event, the captain of each team should nominate which member of their team will get the wildcard for that event. This should be done on WhatsApp.

**Wildcard holders for the event will receive an additional 3 points on their stableford score or 3 shots deducted from their medal score for the team event** (depending on the format of the event)

> If the wildcard holder for a team is not declared before the event, it will be assigned after the event to the **_worst-scoring_** member of the team

# Scoring

Scoring will be taken from the published results of the club competitions on IG. Wildcard adjustments will be made to these scores to produce the final results.

#### Individual Scoring

Event scoring for the individual will be in line with the published results on IG.

_If there is a tie between 2 or more players on the same score, the players' finishing position in the club competition results on IG will be used to decide_. The player that finishes higher in the IG results will be given the higher placing

#### Team Scoring

Team scores will be calculated by combining the **best two scores for each team** from the individual results.

_If there is a tie between two or more teams on the same score, the position of the teams' highest place in the club competition results on IG will be used to decide_. The team with the highest placed finish in the IG results will be given the higher placing.

Teams will be awarded points based on their finishing position. Points will be awarded as follows:

| Position | Points Awarded |
| -------- | -------------- |
| 1st      | 8 points       |
| 2nd      | 7 points       |
| 3rd      | 6 points       |
| 4th      | 5 points       |
| 5th      | 4 points       |
| 6th      | 3 points       |
| 7th      | 2 points       |
| 8th      | 1 point        |

These points are totalled over the season and the three teams with most points after the last event will be awarded the End of Season Team Prizes. If there is a tie for places at the end of the season, the team prize will be shared between the teams tied for that place.
